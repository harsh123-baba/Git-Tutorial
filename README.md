# Git-Tutorial
### Begineers command
1. `git init` -> It intialize a new git repository. What is a repository ?
            It is a folder managed by git where we can track all the changes we are making in the project
2. `git status` ->  There can be a bunch of files that are not currently handled by git. 
            It means that changes done or to be done in those files are not managed by git yet. A file 
            which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area. When we do `**git status**`
            and we see abunch if `untracked files` then these are actually called to be in the working area.
3. `git add <filename>`-> starts tracking your new changes for the next commit
4. `git commit -m <meesage>` -> this creates a new version based on your previous changes.
5. `git log` -> list downs all the commits of the repository. If you want to exit out of git log prompt
            press `q`.
